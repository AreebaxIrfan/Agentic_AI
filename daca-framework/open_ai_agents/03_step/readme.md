# Step 03 : Hands-off Programming & Loops

Welcome! This lesson covers **hands-off programming techniques** (automation, functions, and reusable logic) and dives deep into **Python loops** â€” essential for repeating tasks and controlling program flow.

---

## âœ‹ Hands-off Programming

**Goal**: Automate repetitive tasks using logic and structure so the program "runs on its own" with minimal manual input.

### ðŸ”§ Key Concepts:
- **Functions**: Write once, use many times.
  ```python
  def greet(name):
      return f"Hello, {name}!"
