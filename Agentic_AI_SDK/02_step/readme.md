## 🧠 What is Agentic AI SDK?

Agentic AI SDK is a **Python-first** framework that enables developers to create, deploy, and scale intelligent, cloud-native agents using a plug-and-play model. It's built with the modern developer in mind, simplifying containerization and leveraging **Dapr** for microservice orchestration—no deep Kubernetes expertise required.

## 🌐 Philosophy

- **AI First** 🤖  
- **Cloud First** ☁  
- **Agent Oriented** 💡

Once, we said everything is an API.  
Now, **everything is an Agent**.

## 💡 Core Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dapr Integration**     | Lightweight alternative to Kubernetes, providing built-in scalability, pub/sub, and state management. |
| **A2A (Agent to Agent)** | Agent-to-Agent communication model involving: User, Client Agent, and Server Agent. |
| **MCP Protocol**         | A standardized **Model Context Protocol** ensuring consistent agent communication. |
| **Azure Container Apps** | Seamless container deployment on Azure cloud – just containerize and launch. |
| **Stateless Computing**  | Agents don’t store local state – data persists in the cloud.               |
